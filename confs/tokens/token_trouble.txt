fresh thinking :

just like the hacking token system was changed (callreset.php) , because twitter changed its effective messaging string length ...

we need to rebuild the signin token :: confirm :: calling :: fe :: verify :: token system for confirm :: crowdcc

why ?

this is because of ;

1. email address length of potential 80 chars
2. password length of potential 20 chars
3. increase the reliability of system


what's the problem

- the token is too large clumsy (transmit / receive errors!)

- the token needs to be standardised ( take account of potential lengths of email and passwords * strengthen security )

- move token system(s) into the function lib if required

- make it easier to trace and fix problems with the token system (debug)

- more depth of token tampering / security increased


what's the solution

- back up work after client password renew upgrade
- replace older token creation functions with new

- test renew password with the new functions

- back up work after client email renew upgrade
- replace any older token creation function with new

- test renew email with new functions

backup work and move on ...
