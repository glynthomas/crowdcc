			<h2>Statement of Policies Regarding Data Security & Confidentiality</h2>

			<p><strong>Last updated: January 1, 2015</strong></p>

			<p>Every person using crowdcc expects their data to be private, secure and confidential. We understand how important this is to our customers and work to the best of our abilities to ensure all three expectations are met. Please review the information below regarding our current policies and practices. This is a living document and we will update it as our service evolves and industry practices change.</p>

			<h2>Privacy</h2>

			<p>When you signup to crowdcc either directly using your confirmed email address or via twitter.com or another social network provider we store your details, security infomation is
			   always encrypted (passwords, tokens) in order to protect your information.</p>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>As a company, we use crowdcc everyday, ensuring the service remains secure is vital to protecting our own data. We protect your data with the exact same mechanisms we use to protect our own. The security of your information is required for our success as a business. Below are some details on our security practices.</p>

			<h4>100% Encrypted Traffic, in Both Directions</h4>
			<p>Whether you're at your computer or on your phone, absolutely nothing goes over the network in the clear. crowdcc uses 256-bit AES, supports TLS 1.2 for all of your messages, and uses the ECDHE_RSA Key Exchange Algorithm. We monitor the security community's output closely and work promptly to upgrade the service to respond to new vulnerabilities as they are discovered.</p>

			<h4>External Security Audits</h4>
			<p>We contract with respected external security firms who perform regular audits of Slack to verify that our security practices are sound and to monitor the service in light of new vulnerabilities discovered by the security research community.</p>

			<h4>Secure Physical Location</h4>
			<p>Our servers are located in Amazon's AWS data centers. They've devoted an entire portion of their site to explaining their security measures, which you can find here: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/">http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/</a></p>

			<h4>Experienced Team</h4>
			<p>We've been putting services on the internet for a long time. We're good at it. Our engineering, quality assurance and technical operations team members are experienced and keep their skills up to date as industry best practices evolve. We’ve coded, tested and administered services running on thousands of physical servers in data centers around the world and we bring the collective wisdom that comes with many decades of secure practice to operation of the Crowdcc service.</p>


			<p>We know how important these issues are to you. They are equally important to us. The security, privacy and confidentiality of your information are core to our success as a business and we will continue to be proactive, vigilant and diligent in ensuring its safety.</p>
			<p>If you have additional questions regarding data privacy, security or confidentiality we’d be happy to answer them. Please write to <a href="mailto:feedback@crowdcc.com">feedback@crowdcc.com</a> and we’ll respond as quickly as we can.</p>
			<p>If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Slack, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. See our guidelines on <a href="/terms/bugs">Reporting Security Vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
